# Emergencyventilator

Almost every bed in a hospital has a manual resuscitator (Ambu-Bag) nearby,
available in the event of a rapid response or code where healthcare workers maintain 
oxygenation by squeezing the bag. Automating this appears to be the simplest strategy
that satisfies the need for low-cost mechanical ventilation, with the ability to be
rapidly manufactured in large quantities. 

Here a schematic and a firmware done on Arduino : 
it needs to be reviewed and tested.
